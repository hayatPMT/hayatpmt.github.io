# 🚀 Autonomous-UAV-Navigation-System - Navigate Drones with Ease

[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Release-blue)](https://github.com/hayatPMT/Autonomous-UAV-Navigation-System/releases)

## 📋 Overview

The Autonomous UAV Navigation System enables drones to fly autonomously in complex urban environments. This system uses real-time mapping, global path planning, and sensor fusion for safe navigation. With integration into ROS 2, PX4 Offboard control, and Gazebo simulation, this tool allows for high-fidelity testing and deployment. 

## 🎯 Key Features

- **2.5D Occupancy-Grid Mapping:** Visualize the environment in real-time to understand obstacles and pathways.
- **A* Global Path Planning:** Choose the best route for the drone to reach its destination.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance:** React to moving obstacles effectively to ensure safety during flight.
- **Depth and LiDAR Sensor Fusion:** Combine data from multiple sensors for improved accuracy in navigation.
- **Full Integration with ROS 2 and PX4:** Seamlessly interface with modern communication protocols for robust control.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the Autonomous UAV Navigation System, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Software:**
   - Visit this page to download: [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/hayatPMT/Autonomous-UAV-Navigation-System/releases)

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that you have the necessary software to run this application. You will need:
     - **Python 3.x:** Most recent version preferred. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
     - **ROS 2:** Follow the installation guide available on the ROS 2 website [ros.org](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/).
     - **PX4 Autopilot:** Install PX4 following the guidelines at [px4.io](https://px4.io/docs/).
     - **Gazebo Simulator:** Get Gazebo from [gazebosim.org](http://gazebosim.org/).

3. **Setup the Environment:**
   - After installing the above dependencies, you may need to set up your environment variables. Refer to the installation guides for ROS 2 and PX4 for complete instructions.

## 📥 Download & Install

- Visit this page to download the latest version: [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/hayatPMT/Autonomous-UAV-Navigation-System/releases). 
- Choose the appropriate version for your system and click to download.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

To ensure smooth operation, check the following minimum requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS Catalina or later, or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later.
- **RAM:** Minimum of 8 GB.
- **Processor:** Quad-core Intel or AMD processor.
- **Storage:** At least 5 GB of free disk space.

## ⚙️ Running the Application

1. **Navigate to the Installation Directory:**
   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or equivalent) and change the directory to where the software is installed.

2. **Launch the Software:**
   - Use the command:
     ```
     python3 autopilot.py
     ```
   - This will start the navigation system.

3. **Connect to Your Drone:**
   - Ensure your drone is powered on and connected to your computer. The software will recognize the connection and begin the navigation process.

4. **Start Testing:**
   - Use the GUI to choose your target location. Monitor the real-time mapping and observe how the drone navigates and avoids obstacles.
